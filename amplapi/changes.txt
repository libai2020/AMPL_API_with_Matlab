2.0.0

1.2.1 - 2016-02-10

* Added CMake build script for C++ examples
* Fixed ampl search paths

1.2 - 2016-02-05

* First public beta of the C++ API
* Matlab setup script is now enclosed in a function, to enhance compatibility
  with parallel for loops

1.1 - 2015-11-25

* [Breaking] ``Entity.indexarity()`` now returns 0 for scalar entities.
* ``Entity.hasIndexing()`` is now marked as deprecated, will be removed in
  future versions.
* ``Environment.addToPath()`` is deprecated.
* [New] Added ``Entity.isScalar()``.
* [New] Added ``Objective.sstatus()`` and ``ObjectiveInstance.sstatus()``.
* [New] Added output kinds ``AMPLOutput.SHELL_MESSAGE``,
  ``AMPLOutput.SHELL_OUTPUT`` and ``AMPLOutput.WRITE_TABLE``.
* [Fix] Added support for ``write_table`` AMPL message
* [Fix] Fixed support for string elements containing spaces in
  ``AMPL.setData()``.
* [Fix] Fixed support for entities indexed over empty sets.

1.0 - 2015-05-30

* [Fix] Fixed a bug which was causing AMPL executable to not to be found if
  placed in directories containing spaces in their names in JVM version < 1.7.
* [Fix] Matlab AMPL constructor was quitely ignoring arguments. Now the
  argument can be a string pointing to the directory of the AMPL executable.
* [Breaking] ``AMPLException.toString()`` now uses platform independent
  newlines (``\n``)
* [Fix] ``AMPL.getData()`` now works correctly for compound sets
* [Fix] ``AMPL.getEntity()`` now returns ``null`` for tables.
* [Fix] Now setting the ``PATH`` in the environment class prior to construction
  of the AMPL object is correcly considered.

0.2.4 - 2015-02-04

* [Fix] ``Entity.getValues()`` incorrect handling of entities indexed over sets
  of ``indexarity > 1``.
* Improved performance post issuing of ``AMPL.eval`` command, as only the
  needed entities are updated.
* [Breaking] All ``Table.get`` overloads, ``Table.entrySet``,
  ``Table.getIndices``, ``Table.getValues`` and ``Table.getInstances`` throw
  ``UnsupportedOperationException`` instead of returning ``null``.
* [Breaking] ``Table.getIndexingSets`` and ``Table.getDeclaration`` throw
  ``UnsupportedOperationException`` if the version of the underlying AMPL
  interpreter is < 20150127.
* Improved error reporting in case of crash of the underlying interpreter.
  The last issue command is now reported.
* [Breaking] ``AMPL.toString`` now reports the API version together with the
  AMPL interpreter version.

0.2.2 - 2014-10-09

* [Breaking] ``AMPL.setData`` now has two overloads, ``setData(DataFrame)``
  and ``setData(DataFrame, String)``. These replace the method
  ``setData(DataFrame, bool)``.
  The code

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame, false);

  should be replaced with

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame);

  in the new version. Similarly, the code

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame, true);

  should be replaced with

  .. code:: java

    ampl.setData(dataFrame, setName);

  where ``setName`` is the name of a set to receive the data from the key
  columns of the data frame. This allows providing data for multidimensional
  sets.

* [Breaking] ``Entity.getIndexingSets`` now returns an empty array instead of
  ``null`` for scalar parameters.

* AMPL class can now be used in the try-with-resources statement:

  .. code:: java

    try (AMPL ampl = new AMPL()) {
      // use ampl
    }

* Performance improvements in ``DataFrame.setMatrix``, ``Variable.fix`` and
  other methods
* Improved error reporting from ``Set.setValues``
* [Fix] ``ampl.display`` does not show an error if called on a non existent
  entity
* [Fix] ``AMPL.setData`` silently ignores data for scalar parameter
* [Fix] Incorrect processing of indexed sets in indexing
* [Fix] ``Entity.getValues()`` throws a ``NumberFormatException`` when indexing
  set is empty
* [Fix] ``Objective.value()`` returns the old value after changing variable
  used in objective

0.1.0 - 2014-05-09

* Initial release
